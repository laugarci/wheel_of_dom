# Project Name: Wheel of Doom

_Proposal:_ The Sacrifices Association (SAS) , precursor of major events such as "The Purge", "The Labyrinth", "The Hunger Games", "Battle Royale", "Squid Game", among others, wants to develop a web application for a new coder sacrifice event. The application should be a fair and random sacrifice system in which a draw will be conducted from a list of names.

## Page Name: Monsterly

This project is the game of Wheel of Doom themed after the Monsters, Inc. movie.
We have a main page where we can add names and then, if we wanted to, we can delete them.
A second page where we have different doors that spin until one which is randomly selected as the door of the person who will be "triturated."
And a third page where the selected door that is crushed is shown.

### General Info

_Objective:_
Create a random and fair system for sacrificing coders.

_Methodology and Project Phases:_
We will work in teams, using agile methodologies, specifically the Scrum and Kanban frameworks.
The sprints will be weekly, and the project should be completed within 2 sprints.
Daily stand-up meetings will be held every day, and a retrospective will be conducted after each sprint.
Scrum roles will also be defined.

_Topics:_

- Atomic Design
- Responsive Design (HTML - CSS)
- Pseudoclasses (CSS)
- Box Model (HTML - CSS)
- Events and Event Handlers (JavaScript)
- Functions (JavaScript)
- DOM (JavaScript - HTML)

### Functional Requirements

- The application MUST have a list of names.
- The application MUST select a name from the list of coders to sacrifice.
- The application MUST display a notification with the name of the sacrificed coder.
- Once a name is selected, it MUST NOT reappear in the list until the application is reset.
- The application MUST have the functionality to add or remove names.
- The application MUST have various animations and transitions.
- The application MUST have events that trigger animations.
- The application MUST have sound effects.
- The application MUST have a home screen.
- The application MUST have a reset button.
- The application MUST display a notification when the last coder is sacrificed.
- The application MUST return to the home screen when the last coder is sacrificed.
- The application MUST be mobile-first.
- The application MUST be responsive for at least 2 breakpoints.
  ⭐ Bonus - The application MAY be responsive for landscape-oriented devices.
  ⭐ Bonus - Ensure data persistence using local storage.

### Quality Attributes

- Atomic design will be used in the UI design.
- The application's design MUST be creative, interactive, and engaging (it SHOULD NOT be the typical roulette design).
- The application should have a coherent folder structure.
- It should have good naming conventions for classes, IDs, functions, etc.
- The theme of the application is freely chosen.
- The project must use Git and be uploaded on GitHub.
- Any CSS library or preprocessor like SASS can be used.
- The application should include unit tests using any testing library (Jest, Cypress, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai, etc.).
